- What is your experience in using the RRS ? 
“For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.”
- Do you use open repositories to store information? (ArXiv, Zenodo)

## Extras
- Open Peer Review: What are your thoughts on open peer review models where reviewer identities and reports are made public? Would this improve the quality and collegiality of mathematical feedback, or would it discourage candid criticism?

# Open Data
- What is Data in Mathematics? (Numerical Data,)
Numerical Data : Digits of Pi, Numerical outputs of a simulation modeling a system of differential equations.
Symbolic and Structural Data : A catalog of all finite simple groups, a database of knots with up to 10 crossings, a collection of graphs with specific properties (like being non-Hamiltonian, or a set of geometric shapes.
Logical Data: Results, Axioms, Counter-examples
- Do you use any open data banks ? (Zenodo, Hugging Face,  ...)

# Open Code and Version Control
- Platforms like GitHub are meant to facilitate collaboration. Have you successfully used them for a collaborative mathematical project? What were the social or technical pain points you encountered when trying to get your co-authors on board?
- Is there value in sharing this "messy" intellectual journey, or should we only present the final, polished result?
- Fear of research being plagerised by other people on GitHub?
