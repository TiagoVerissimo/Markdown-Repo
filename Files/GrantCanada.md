# Aplication for Grant Canada

## **Abstract: The International Workshop in Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA) 2026**
The International Workshop in Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA) is a premier annual conference that serves as a global nexus for mathematicians. Scheduled to be held at Laval University in Quebec City, Canada, IWOTA 2026 continues a long-standing tradition, initiated in 1981, of fostering intensive exchange on the latest advancements in operator theory and its rapidly expanding applications.

IWOTA 2026 will be from the 3rd to the 7th of August 2026.

At its core, the workshop is dedicated to the study of operators, a field of functional analysis that extends the principles of linear algebra to infinite-dimensional spaces. The scientific program is intentionally broad, encompassing a rich spectrum of theoretical topics. These include, but are not limited to, spectral theory, operator algebras, complex and harmonic analysis, multivariable operator theory, matrix analysis, and the study of operators on various function spaces.

A defining characteristic of IWOTA is its strong emphasis on the practical application and cross-disciplinary nature of the field. The workshop actively bridges the gap between pure theory and real-world problems. Consequently, a significant portion of the program is devoted to applications in diverse areas such as:

* **Mathematical Physics:** Including quantum mechanics, spectral theory of differential operators, and random matrix theory.
* **Systems Theory and Control Theory:** Analyzing the behavior of dynamical systems.

IWOTA provides a vital platform for leading experts to deliver plenary lectures on seminal developments, while also offering numerous special sessions and contributed talks. This structure creates an invaluable opportunity for all participants, from established researchers to PhD students and early-career scientists, to present their work, engage in rigorous discussion, and forge new international collaborations. By bringing together a diverse intellectual community, IWOTA 2026 will continue to trace the future developments of the field and catalyze innovation across science and engineering.

## Placement of the Conference
The conference will be held at Laval University, located in Quebec City, Canada and it is in person.

## Explain personal links with the conference

I have been researching Moment Problems for about a year in my PhD and now in the second year I have some material that would add value to this conference in the arena of Moment Problems. My supervisor, Prof. Dr. David Kimsey from Newcastle University, is a specialist in Moment Problems and he has been attending IWOTA for many years, considering it to be one of the best places to present research in Moment Problems.

## Explain how participating in the conference will benefit their career and professional development.

My academic career would be benefited given that I would be able to present my research in front of experts in the field and get feedback from them. This would help me improve my research and also get new ideas for future research. Additionally, I would be able to network with other researchers in the field, which could lead to future collaborations and job opportunities.

## Explain how the conference will benefit from their participation.

The conference would benefit from my participation as I would be able to present my research in the area of Moment Problems, which is a topic of interest to many researchers in the field. My research could potentially lead to new insights and developments in the field, as my research is currently being made with a novel approach to moment problems that would bring a fresh perspective to other researchers. Additionally, I would be able to contribute to the discussions and debates that take place during the conference, which would enhance the overall experience for all participants.

## Choose the Sustainable Development Goal(s) which relate most closely to their research and describe how their research can contribute to achieving these goals.

The Sustainable Development Goal most closely related to my research is Goal 4: Quality Education, interpreted through the lens of advancing scientific knowledge. My work on Moment Problems contributes by pushing the boundaries of mathematical theory and developing new tools for analysis. These advancements strengthen the foundations of applied and theoretical mathematics, which are essential for progress in fields such as data science, physics, and engineering. By addressing open questions and proposing innovative approaches, this research not only enriches the mathematical community but also creates opportunities for future applications in technology and science, thereby indirectly supporting high-quality education and research worldwide.

## A detailed letter or email of support from their head of department commenting on the suitability of the conference and how participating in the conference will be beneficial.

It will be done by the supervisor.
